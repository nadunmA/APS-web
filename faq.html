                <p>Automated Parking systems rely on technology similar to what is used in manufacturing and warehouse<br>facilities worldwide for cost effective movement of materials, pallets, etc.<br><br>
                    Automated Parking uses computer-controlled vertical lifts and horizontal shuttles or robotic valets  to transport<br>vehicles from an arrival area to a remote compartment for storage without human assistance.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="qAnswers">
                <p>There are many benefits to automated parking systems. One benefit is that you can fit twice as many vehicles<br>or more in the same space utilized for a conventional garage or use half or less the real estate space for the same<br>number of cars.
                    Other benefits include less excavation for below grade garages or more<br>leasable/sellable square footage for above ground garages.</p>

                <h3>What is the cost per space for an Automated Parking System?</h3>
                <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
            </div>
            <div class="qAnswers">
                <p>This is another “it depends” answer. The cost per space of a Automated/Mechanical Parking System depends<br>on several factors:<br><br>
                    1. The layout of the project<br>
                    2. The type of system being used<br>
                    3. The total number of parking spaces needed<br>
                    4. The required throughput of the system<br>
                    5. Where the project is located at geographically<br><br>
                    These variables are of equal importance in the equation for project estimate calculations and can result in prices<br>ranging from $9,000 to $45,000 (USD) per space.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="qAnswers">
                <p>Most Automated Parking Systems tout retrieval times of 2-3 minutes. However, depending on type of system, technology,<br>and configuration, this number could vary when several people arrive at the same time requesting vehicles from the same area of the garage.</p>

                <p>Automated Parking Systems provide true redundancy with multiple elements controlling the same process to provide<br>alternatives in case of a component failure.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="qAnswers">
                <p>It depends on the system. But in essence, the driver’s experience of an automated parking system begins as the driver drives onto a platform and parks their vehicle with the help of sensors. The user gathers their belongings and exits the vehicle.</p>
